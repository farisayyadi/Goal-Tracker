## Goal Tracker - My First React Native Project ##
This is my first React Native project where I built a simple Goal Tracker app. It allows users to add, view, and delete goals. 
The app also uses modal popups for input and displays goals in a scrollable list.

## Features ##
Add Goal: Enter a new goal and add it to the list.
Delete Goal: Remove a goal by tapping on it.
Modal Input: A modal opens when adding a new goal.
Styled UI: Basic styling using React Native's built-in components.
